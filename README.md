The Texas Exes San Francisco Bay Area Chapter (https://www.facebook.com/groups/sflonghorns/) needed a conference line for their board meetings, volunteer calls, etc. Now they have one.

To use this code, point a Twilio phone number to the conference.xml file. When you dial the number, you'll hear the sweet sounds of the University of Texas Longhorns fight song (looped for 15 minutes).

Once a second caller dials in, the hold music ends, and you will be joined into the conference.

Every caller that joins will be accompanied by a beep. Similarly, every caller that drops out of the conference will be accompanied by a beep.
